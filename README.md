# JavaScript Gettext
JavaScript Gettext from http://jsgettext.sourceforge.net

JavaScript Gettext is an open source JavaScript implementation of the GNU Gettext API. It differs from existing javascript implementations in that it will support all current Gettext features (ex. plural and context support), and will also support loading language catalogs from .mo, .po, or preprocessed json files (converter included).
